\section{Case study parameter results}

The parameters presented here come from a run of \texttt{EM-VRSO} with $A = \text{SAGA}$, $P = \texttt{True}$, and $M=10T$. They represent the parameters with the highest log-likelihood among all random initializations and optimization algorithms in the case study from the main text. 

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c|c|lll}
\multicolumn{1}{l|}{Dive Type} & Parameter Estimate & Descent & Bottom & Ascent \\ \hline
\multirow{3}{*}{1}            & $\hat \mu$     & 0.70    & 0.02   & -0.67  \\
                              & $\hat \sigma$  & 0.45    & 0.23   & 0.40   \\
                              & $\hat p$       & \bf{0}  & \bf{0} & 0.12   \\ \hline 
\multirow{3}{*}{2}            & $\hat \mu$     & 0.33    & 0.00   & -0.44  \\
                              & $\hat \sigma$  & 0.15    & 0.15   & 0.21   \\
                              & $\hat p$       & \bf{0}  & \bf{0} & 0.47   \\ \hline
\multirow{3}{*}{3}            & $\hat \mu$     & 2.71    & 0.01   & -2.50  \\
                              & $\hat \sigma$  & 1.85    & 0.64   & 1.58   \\
                              & $\hat p$       & \bf{0}  & \bf{0} & 0.04  
\end{tabular}
\caption{Maximum likelihood parameter estimates from the Killer Whale case study described in the main text. Recall that $D_t$ represents the change in depth in meters at time index $t$ and $E_t \in \{0,1\}$ encodes whether a dive ends at time index $t$. The parameter $\mu$ corresponds to the state-dependent mean of $D_t$, $\sigma$ corresponds to the state-dependent standard deviation of $D_t$, and $p$ corresponds to the state-dependent probability that $E_t=1$.}
\end{table}

Figure (\ref{fig:emission_dist}) below shows the estimated densities of change in depth $D_t$ for all dive types and dive durations.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=6.5in]{../plt/emission_dists_K_3_3_nWhales_8.png}
    \caption{State-dependent density of change in depth for dive types 1, 2, and 3 (left to right). Fine-scale state 1 corresponds to descent, fine-scale state 2 corresponds to bottom, and fine-scale state 3 corresponds to ascent. Dive type 1 corresponds to medium-depth dives, dive type 2 corresponds to shallow dives, and dive type 3 corresponds to deep dives.}
    \label{fig:emission_dist}
\end{figure}

The coarse-scale, inter-dive transition probability matrix and initial distribution estimates were 

\begin{gather}
    \hat \bfGamma^{(c)} = 
    \begin{pmatrix} 
    0.223 & 0.758 & 0.017 \\
    0.123 & 0.853 & 0.027 \\
    0.074 & 0.857 & 0.068
    \end{pmatrix}, \\
    %
    \hat \bfdelta^{(c)} = \begin{pmatrix} 0.258 & 0.002 & 0.740 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{gather}

The long-run proportion of each dive type is found by solving for the stationary distribution of $\hat \bfGamma^{(c)}$, i.e. solving the equation $\hat \bfpi^{(c)} \hat \bfGamma^{(c)} = \hat \bfpi^{(c)}$. Doing so gives the following:
%
\begin{equation}
    \hat \bfpi^{(c)} = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0.136 & 0.840 & 0.024
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
%
In words, approximately 13.6\% of all dives are of type 1 (medium-depth), 84.0\% of all dives are of type 2 (shallow), and 2.4\% of all dives are of type 3 (deep).

The fine-scale, intra-dive transition probability matrices and initial distributions were estimated as

\begin{gather}
    \hat \bfGamma^{(f,1)} = 
    \begin{pmatrix} 
    0.871 & 0.123 & 0.006 \\
    \bf{0} & 0.962 & 0.038 \\
    \bf{0} & \bf{0} & \bf{1}
    \end{pmatrix}, ~
    %
    \hat \bfGamma^{(f,2)} = 
    \begin{pmatrix} 
    0.668 & 0.304 & 0.028 \\
    \bf{0} & 0.788 & 0.212 \\
    \bf{0} & \bf{0} & \bf{1}
    \end{pmatrix}, ~
    %
    \hat \bfGamma^{(f,3)} = 
    \begin{pmatrix} 
    0.958 & 0.040 & 0.002 \\
    \bf{0} & 0.982 & 0.018 \\
    \bf{0} & \bf{0} & \bf{1}
    \end{pmatrix}, \\
    %
    \hat \bfdelta^{(f,1)} = \begin{pmatrix} \bf{1} & \bf{0} & \bf{0} \end{pmatrix}, \quad ~
    %
    \hat \bfdelta^{(f,2)} = \begin{pmatrix} \bf{1} & \bf{0} & \bf{0} \end{pmatrix}, \quad ~
    %
    \hat \bfdelta^{(f,3)} = \begin{pmatrix} \bf{1} & \bf{0} & \bf{0} \end{pmatrix}
\end{gather}

Recall that each dive must begin with descent, so all initial distributions are identical. In addition, note that the Markov chains defined by $\hat \bfGamma^{(f,i)}$ above are not ergodic, so stationary distributions do not exist for the fine-scale, intra-dive Markov chains.

\section{Case study decoded dive profiles}
