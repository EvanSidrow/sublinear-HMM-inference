\begin{abstract}
    Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are popular models often used to identify a finite number of discrete latent states from sequential data. However, fitting them to large data sets can be computationally demanding as it usually requires iterating through the entire data set for every parameter update. Specifically, numerical optimization methods involve a full pass of the data to evaluate the gradient of the likelihood, and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm requires a full pass of the data to perform its E step. The EM algorithm also requires numerical optimization for the M step if no closed-form solution exists. We propose an optimization algorithm that updates the parameters of an HMM without iterating through the entire data set. Namely, we implement a partial E step and combine it within a variance-reduced stochastic optimization scheme for the M step. We prove that our algorithm converges under certain regularity conditions. Using a simulation study and kinematic data from eight killer whales ({\em{Orcinus orca}}) off the western coast of Canada, we show that our algorithm converges in fewer epochs compared to standard numerical optimization techniques. Our algorithm also tends to converge to parameters estimates with higher likelihood compared to existing baselines.  As such, our algorithm allows practitioners to more efficiently fit complicated HMMs to increasingly large time-series data sets.
