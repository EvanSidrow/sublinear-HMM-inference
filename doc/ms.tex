\chapter{Multi-scale methods}

This chapter, together with Appendix A, appears verbatim in a special edition of Canadian Journal of Statistics focusing on functional data analysis. It is titled \textit{Modelling multi-scale, state-switching functional data with hidden Markov models} \citep{Sidrow:2021}.
