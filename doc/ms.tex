\begin{abstract}
    Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are popular models to identify a finite number of discrete latent states from sequential data. However, fitting them to large data sets can be computationally demanding as it usually requires iterating through the entire underlying data set for every parameter update. Specifically, numerical optimization methods require a full pass of the data to evaluate the gradient of the likelihood, and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm requires a full data pass to perform its E step before each parameter update. The EM algorithm also often requires numerical optimization to perform its M step. We propose an optimization algorithm that updates the parameters of an HMM without iterating through the entire data set. Namely, we combine a partial E step with variance-reduced stochastic optimization within the M step. We also prove the algorithm converges under certain regularity conditions. Using simulations and a case study of kinematic data from eight killer whales ({\em{Orcinus orca}}) off the western coast of Canada, we show that our algorithm converges in fewer epochs and to regions of higher likelihood compared to standard numerical optimization techniques. Our algorithm allows practitioners to fit complicated HMMs to large time-series data sets more efficiently than existing baselines.
